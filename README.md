This Repo is The Graph State Challenge Solution,
made by Kalyuzhner Frima With Great help of Emanuele Dalla-Torre and Adi Makmal.

All the notebook have been created through Google Colab - so we reccomend to work there.
(also, if you want to get again the learning processing after one run, you should restart runtime in order to get the same fitting process).

the process of creating our NN model is in the Graph_State_Challenge_Submission_The_Learning_Process notebook,
Graph_State_Challenge_Submission_The_Results is the real casablanca results notebook - where we check their fidelity.

besides these 2 notebooks, we have 3 files - 2 npy files and a NN folder:

result_backend.npy - real casablanca system measurements.
result_mit_backend.npy - real casablanca system measurement's mitigation for IBM CTMP method in order to evaluate.
model/NN model of IBM prize - The NN folder model that's been created.
