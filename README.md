This Repo is The Graph State Challenge Solution.

All the notebook have been created through Google Colab - so we reccomend to work there.

the process of creating our NN model is in the Graph_State_Challenge_Submission_The_Learning_Process notebook,
Graph_State_Challenge_Submission_The_Results is the real casablanca results notebook - where we check their fidelity.

besides these 2 jupyter notebooks, we have 3 files - 2 npy files and a NN folder:

result_backend.npy - real casablanca system measurements.
result_mit_backend.npy - real casablanca system measurement's mitigation for IBM CTMP method in order to evaluate.
model/NN model of IBM prize - The NN folder model that's been created.
